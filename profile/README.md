 [Holo Interactive](https://holoi.com) is a creative spatial computing lab, previously [Amber Garage](https://ambergarage.com), founded by [Botao Amber Hu](https://botao.hu).

* ðŸ¥½ **Innovation at its Best**: We have released an stereoscopic optical see-through AR headset [HoloKit X](https://holokit.io) in 2022, which is an [award-winning](https://www.red-dot.org/project/holokit-x-64930) premium-quality upgrade from our original periscope-shaped invention [HoloKit 1](https://1.holokit.io/), a cardboard proof of concept released in 2017. 
* ðŸ“² **Full AR Functionalities**: Without reinventing the wheel, our open-source, phone-based AR headset maximizes your smartphone's existing AR functionalities, such as ARKit, hand-tracking and LiDAR.
* ðŸ’² **Accessible Immersion**: With a 60-degree FOV, experience a rich, immersive mixed reality that stands as a cost-effective alternative to 20x-30x pricier options like [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy) and [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/buy-now).
* ðŸŽ¨ **For Creators by Creators**: Tailored for quick and efficient MR creative project execution, especially in multiplayer scenarios, HoloKit, is a go-to tool for **MR researchers, educators, and creators**.

More Than Just Hardware:
Composed of MR researchers, educators, and creators, our team perfectly aligns with HoloKit's target users. 
We delve beyond just hardware, continuously exploring and pioneering creative paradigms in MR leveraging HoloKit.

* [Multiplayer Onsite Fighting Arena (MOFA)](https://mofa.ar) is a multiplayer MR game framework for casting magic spells, in which we explored paradigms of competitive, cooperative, asymmetric mixed reality game design strategies. Awarded as the best interactivity demo in CHI 2023 and honorable mention in best demo in ISMAR 2023, and Flow Hackathon.
* We open-sourced sample creative projects for your inspirations.
  * [HoloKit x Immersal Multiplayer Boilerplate](https://github.com/holoi/immersal-holokit-samples) for multiplayer in fixed scenarios (pre-scan required)  
  * [HoloKit x InstantColocation Multiplayer Boilerplate](https://github.com/holoi/immersal-holokit-samples) for multiplayer in ad-hoc scenarios (pre-scan not required)
