 [Holo Interactive](https://holoi.com) is a creative spatial computing lab, born from [Amber Garage](https://ambergarage.com) founded by [Botao Amber Hu](https://botao.hu).

* ðŸ¥½ **Innovation at its Best**: We have invented an stereoscopic optical see-through AR headset - [HoloKit](https://holokit.io).
* ðŸ“² **Full AR Functionalities**: Without reinventing the wheel, our open-source, phone-based AR headset maximizes your smartphone's existing AR functionalities, such as ARKit and LiDAR.
* ðŸ’² **Accessible Immersion**: With a 60-degree FOV, experience a rich, immersive mixed reality that stands as a cost-effective alternative to pricier options like HoloLens and Magic Leap.
* ðŸŽ¨ **Designed for Creators**: Tailored for quick and efficient MR creative project execution, especially in multiplayer scenarios, HoloKit, is a go-to tool for MR researchers, educators, and creators.
